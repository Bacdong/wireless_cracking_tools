Wireless Cracking Tool
======

This repo is a Python script for auditing wireless networks.

Wifite runs existing wireless-auditing tools for you. Stop memorizing command arguments & switches!

To run:
----------
```
cd wifite2
sudo ./Wifite.py
```

Installation:
--------------
To install onto your computer (so you can just run `wifite` from any terminal), run:

```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router).  These methods include:
1. WPS: The [Offline Pixie-Dust attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)
1. WPS: The [Online Brute-Force PIN attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Online_brute-force_attack)
2. WPA: The [WPA Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
3. WPA: The [PMKID Hash Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
4. WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including *fragmentation*, *chop-chop*, *aireplay*, etc.

Run wifite, select your targets, and Wifite will automatically start trying to capture or crack the password.

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
Wifite is designed specifically for the latest version of [**Kali** Linux](https://www.kali.org/). [ParrotSec](https://www.parrotsec.org/) is also supported.

Other pen-testing distributions (such as BackBox or Ubuntu) have outdated versions of the tools used by Wifite. Do not expect support unless you are using the latest versions of the *Required Tools*, and also [patched wireless drivers that support injection]().

Required Tools
--------------
First and foremost, you will need a wireless card capable of "Monitor Mode" and packet injection (see [this tutorial for checking if your wireless card is compatible](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards) and also [this guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)). There are many cheap wireless cards that plug into USB available from online stores.

Second, only the latest versions of these programs are supported and must be installed for Wifite to work properly:

**Required:**

* `python`: Wifite is compatible with both `python2` and `python3`.
* [`iwconfig`](https://wiki.debian.org/iwconfig): For identifying wireless devices already in Monitor Mode.
* [`ifconfig`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig): For starting/stopping wireless devices.
* [`Aircrack-ng`](http://aircrack-ng.org/) suite, includes:
   * [`airmon-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airmon-ng): For enumerating and enabling Monitor Mode on wireless devices.
   * [`aircrack-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aircrack-ng): For cracking WEP .cap files and WPA handshake captures.
   * [`aireplay-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/aireplay-ng): For deauthing access points, replaying capture files, various WEP attacks.
   * [`airodump-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/airodump-ng): For target scanning & capture file generation.
   * [`packetforge-ng`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/packetforge-ng): For forging capture files.

**Optional, but Recommended:**

* [`tshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html): For detecting WPS networks and inspecting handshake capture files.
* [`reaver`](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Note: Reaver's `wash` tool can be used to detect WPS networks if `tshark` is not found.
* [`bully`](https://github.com/aanarchyy/bully): For WPS Pixie-Dust & brute-force attacks.
   * Alternative to Reaver. Specify `--bully` to use Bully instead of Reaver.
   * Bully is also used to fetch PSK if `reaver` cannot after cracking WPS PIN.
* [`coWPAtty`](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/cowpatty): For detecting handshake captures.
* [`pyrit`](https://github.com/JPaulMora/Pyrit): For detecting handshake captures.
* [`hashcat`](https://hashcat.net/): For cracking PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxdumptool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool): For capturing PMKID hashes.
   * [`hcxpcaptool`](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools): For converting PMKID packet captures into `hashcat`'s format.
